# ViktorBrain

ViktorBrain is a neural simulation system designed to complement ViktorAI. The system simulates a virtual neural network that represents Viktor's "brain," which influences and shapes the responses generated by the ViktorAI system.

## Project Organization

The project is now organized into the following directories:

```
ViktorBrain/
├── src/                 # Core source code for the brain simulation
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts for management
├── config/              # Configuration files and Docker settings
├── docs/                # Documentation files
├── ui/                  # User interface files
│   └── chat.html        # Web interface for interacting with the system
├── results/             # Simulation results (states, visualizations, etc.)
├── sessions/            # Session data for active brain instances
├── tests/               # Unit and integration tests
├── api.py               # Main API for interacting with the brain
├── viktor.py            # Main entry point and launcher script
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

## Usage

The system can be run using the simple launcher in the root directory:

```bash
# Show available commands
python viktor.py --help

# Start the system
python viktor.py start

# Stop the system
python viktor.py stop
```

We've added a comprehensive system control script that simplifies management of the entire ViktorBrain ecosystem:

### Starting the System

```bash
# Start both ViktorBrain and ViktorAI
python scripts/start_system.py start

# Start with custom neuron count
python scripts/start_system.py start --neurons 10000

# Start only the brain component
python scripts/start_system.py start --brain-only

# Start only the AI component
python scripts/start_system.py start --ai-only
```

### Stopping the System

```bash
# Stop both components
python scripts/start_system.py stop

# Stop only the brain
python scripts/start_system.py stop --brain-only

# Stop only the AI
python scripts/start_system.py stop --ai-only
```

### Checking Status

```bash
python scripts/start_system.py status
```

### Opening the Chat Interface

```bash
python scripts/start_system.py chat
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run a simple ping test
python scripts/start_system.py test

# Run a chat test
python scripts/start_system.py test --command chat
```

### Managing Results

```bash
# Show what would be removed (older than 30 days)
python scripts/start_system.py clean --days 30 --dry-run

# Actually remove old results
python scripts/start_system.py clean --days 30

# Generate a summary report of all simulations
python scripts/start_system.py report
```

### Running Standalone Simulations

```bash
# Run a simulation with default settings
python scripts/start_system.py simulate

# Run a custom simulation
python scripts/start_system.py simulate --neurons 5000 --steps 200
```

## Advanced Management Options

For more advanced options, you can still use the individual scripts directly:

```bash
# Detailed results management
python scripts/clean_results.py --remove-state
python scripts/clean_results.py --compress

# View detailed simulation results
python scripts/view_results.py --list
python scripts/view_results.py --id 1
```

## Local vs Docker Deployment

The system supports both local deployment for development and Docker deployment for production:

### Local Deployment (Current)

- Maximum performance with direct host execution
- Access to full system resources
- Higher neuron counts supported
- Recommended for development and experimentation

### Docker Deployment

- Containerized for isolation and portability
- Easier deployment across different systems
- More consistent environment
- Docker files in the `config/` directory
